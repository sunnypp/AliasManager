# AliasManager
Perl Based Alias Manager for Quick and Dirty Setup in macOS.

Intended to create a gist, but after some thoughts, it'd be very nice if I could later update this `am` to:
1. Support multi-line alias;
2. Support customized `rc` path: `.bashrc` (current), `.zshrc`, `.bash_profile` just to name a few;
3. Support import and export as... JSON perhaps?  YAML is also good.

Thus, I created this repo in the hope that I would have the leisure to update this later -- of course PR is welcomed!
